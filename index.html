        <h2>Problem statement: [OTC Medication App]</h2>
        <p>
          Adolescents often lack guidance in self-administering common over-the-counter medications like Tylenol and Advil, relying on parental advice through phone calls. To foster independence and ensure safe self-care practices, there is a need for an Over-the-Counter Medication App. This app will enable adolescents to input symptoms, receive personalized medication suggestions, and receive reminders for timely doses, promoting responsible medication management among the youth.
